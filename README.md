This project was created to ease other's journeys in creating
their own custom async executors. The codebase respectifully derives
from other developers in futures-rs (the license is in their names). 
The aim is to provide the most absolute minimal waker system and provide 
clarity into how one of the most challenging parts of async-await works.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
woke = "0.0.1"
```
The current `async-await` feature requires Rust 1.39 or later.
